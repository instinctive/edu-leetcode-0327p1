## Notes

This problem is dominated by reading the input file.

[C++ Solutions](https://github.com/instinctive/edu-leetcode-0327p1/blob/main/cpp/ccalg.cpp):
The video likes the `equal_range` solution for C++. I've compared it
to the most obvious C++ solution I could come up with. The results are
essentially equivalent, and I agree that the use of `equal_range` is
aesthetically pleasing.

[Haskell Solutions](https://github.com/instinctive/edu-leetcode-0327p1/blob/main/src/HSAlg.hs):
The video uses a two-pass solution for Haskell, where the input is
filtered twice. I've added a one-pass solution. The results are very different,
and in fact the Haskell one-pass solution is faster than the C++ solutions.
